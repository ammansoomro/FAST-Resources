HR :
* The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic).
* The <hr> element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

DIV: - The Content Division element
is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

CENTER : 
The HTML <center> tag is used to center the text horizontally in the HTML document. In HTML5, it is recommended that you use the CSS text-align property to format the text horizontally in the document.

MULTICOL:
The HTML <multicol> tag is used to create multiple columns of text in html 4. (Obsolete)
