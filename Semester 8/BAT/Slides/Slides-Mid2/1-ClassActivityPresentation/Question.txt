Dear Students 
Here is the resource documents and case studies for B2C, B2B and Marketplace. You have to pick one group out of the three topics. Each group should distribute related articles accordingly among the members. You should make a power point presentation (google doc) and conclude all the  papers. 
Each of the group will present their topic in the next class (next week). 
Each member will  be awarded '2' marks based on the contribution made in the ppt. (You should mention your name and article name against the added point in the ppt)
Each member will be awarded '3' marks based on the understanding developed through the reading material. 


The three groups will present their part in 30 mins. In absence of the PPT, the '2 marks' will be wasted.
