- Malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam e-mail)
- Malware that does replicate (viruses and worms)

User input,

- Attackers inject SQL commands by providing suitable crafted user inputServer variables
- Attackers can forge the values that are placed in HTTP and network headers and exploit this vulnerability by placing data directly into the headers

Second-order injection,

Cookies,

Physical user input,
-Applying user input that constructs an attack outside the realm of web requests
